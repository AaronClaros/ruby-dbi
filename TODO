* Cleanup:
 * Pg
  * Tests:
      * LOB tests don't clean up LOBs, just the tables that hold them 
      * Transaction Tests (AutoCommit on and off, ensuring rollback, etc)
      * more fetch tests
  * Arrays:
      * Find some way to get the extents of an array type
       * checked pg_type, pg_attribute and pg_class, can't find anything.
      x Get rid of that array parser
       x But test it first
 * Mysql
x Remove all other drivers
 * Not sure what to do with ODBC and Proxy yet.
* Finish type management system
 * DBI tests
 * Find a better way to leverage lower-level binding APIs
 x Gut old typing system
* Cleanup core
 x Remove DBI::DIR crap
 x Require code is a mess
 * Find a good clean way to enumerate drivers in separate gems
* Packaging:
 * Add stock setup.rb to all tarballs, including drivers
 * Ideally, move DBD-specific tests to DBD packages
 * Remove custom setup.rb
* Scripts:
 * What to do with these? I doubt they still work.
