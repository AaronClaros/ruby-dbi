* Cleanup:
 * Pg
  * Tests:
      * LOB tests don't clean up LOBs, just the tables that hold the OIDs
      * Transaction Tests (AutoCommit on and off, ensuring rollback, etc)
      * more fetch tests
  * Arrays:
      * Find some way to get the extents of an array type
       * checked pg_type, pg_attribute and pg_class, can't find anything.
      x Get rid of that array parser
       x But test it first
 * Mysql
  x find a better way to handle the ColumnInfo stuff; currently monkeypatching
 * Tracing
  * WTH do we want to do with this
   * Wow, this module has *serious issues*. Crashes DBI without warning. Redo this completely.
x Remove all other drivers
 x ODBC
 x Proxy
  x Slated for 0.6.0
* Finish type management system
 x DBI tests
 * bind_coltype (see prototypes/types.rb)
 * You should be able to turn off the type management system
 * Find a better way to leverage lower-level binding APIs
  * Binding API for PostgreSQL in particular
 x Unify ColumnInfo
  x see "Mysql" above
  * Should we enforce ColumnInfo requirements at the DBI level?
   * At least test the result of statement colinfo uniformly
 x Gut old typing system
  x Notify user that Date/Time/Timestamp are deprecated
* Cleanup core
 x Remove DBI::DIR crap
 * Require code is a mess
  * Just remove the case-sensitivity from the DBDs in general
 * Find a good clean way to enumerate drivers in separate gems
  * Some registration-on-require would be cleaner and safer
x Packaging
 x Add stock setup.rb to all tarballs, including drivers
 x Ideally, move DBD-specific tests to DBD packages
 x Remove custom setup.rb
 x Custom Rakefile for DBDs
 * Add dependencies for DBDs
x Scripts
 x What to do with these? I doubt they still work.
  x bin/dbi working
  x bin/dbd_proxy seems to have never worked; slate it for 0.6.0
