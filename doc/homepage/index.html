                <p>
                Ruby/DBI is a database interface in the spirit of Perl's prolific
                <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~timb/DBI/DBI.pm">DBI</a> authored
                by Tim Bunce.
                </p>

                <p>
                Ruby/DBI differs in quite a few ways, however. It incorporates many
                "rubyisms" while maintaining the core DBI interface, and
                (currently) includes it's own suite of DBD's which are maintained
                with the application.
                </p>

                <p>
                Ruby/DBI is <i>not</i> an ORM, like <a
                    href="http://ar.rubyonrails.com">ActiveRecord</a> or <a
                    href="http://datamapper.rubyforge.org">DataMapper</a>. It is a
                lightweight, centralized API to database manipulation. An ORM may
                or may not be what you want for a given situation, due to weight,
                ease-of-use or other issues. Our goal with Ruby/DBI is to provide a
                compelling, lightweight interface that you can use for things where
                an ORM is too much or too cumbersome.
                </p>

                <p>
                Getting started with Ruby/DBI is very easy if you have a working
                knowledge of SQL and your target database. Read the <a
                    href="http://ruby-dbi.rubyforge.org/rdoc/index.html">Documentation</a>
                to get on your way!
                </p>

                <p>
                The maintainers, Erik Hollensbe and Christopher Maujean, have a
                commitment to keeping Ruby/DBI compatible with future Ruby releases
                and an interest in enhancing the suite by reducing the code
                footprint and re-using established database interfaces in our
                drivers.
                </p>

                <p>
                Ruby/DBI is a very old project as far as the ruby community is
                concerned, tracing back to at least 2004. There are plenty of
                people who <a
                    href="http://ruby-dbi.rubyforge.org/rdoc/index.html">have
                    contributed</a> to this effort. Big thanks to the original
                project lead, Francis Hwang, and Daniel Berger, who held the
                project in escrow for such a long time.
