            <p>
            Ruby/DBI is a database interface in the spirit of Perl's prolific
            <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~timb/DBI/DBI.pm">DBI</a> authored
            by Tim Bunce.
            </p>

            <p>
            Ruby/DBI differs in quite a few ways, however. It incorporates many
            "rubyisms" while maintaining the core DBI interface, and
            (currently) includes it's own suite of DBD's which are maintained
            with the application.
            </p>

            <p>
            Ruby/DBI is <i>not</i> an ORM, like <a
                href="http://ar.rubyonrails.com">ActiveRecord</a> or <a
                href="http://datamapper.rubyforge.org">DataMapper</a>. It is a
            lightweight, centralized API to database manipulation. An ORM may
            or may not be what you want for a given situation, due to weight,
            ease-of-use or other issues. Our goal with Ruby/DBI is to provide a
            compelling, lightweight interface that you can use for things where
            an ORM is too much or too cumbersome.
