= ToDo
== General bugs:
* StatementHandle#fetch(...) should return nil if no more rows are available. But it returns nil only the first time, after that it raises "DBI::InterfaceError: Statement must first be executed".
* DBI::Timestamp cannot compare with nil.
* Unpacking an empty field fails on an ia64 Linux system.
* DBI.load_driver will fail silently if it can't find a driver, instead of raising an exception.

== Bugs with Frontbase:
* DBI interface is 7.5x slower than raw access to the Frontbase driver.

== Bugs with MySQL:
* MySQL DBD needs to read options from client to handle text from non-latin1 tables.
* DBI raises on encountering 0000-00-00 00:00 00 in mysql datetime columns.

== Bugs with PostgreSQL:
* Though the document says that 'tables' method returns an Array of all tables and views, 'tables' method in Pg driver only returns an Array of all tables.
* PGresult#type raises system runtime error.
* PGconn.quote is not supporting Shift-JIS encoding
* AutoCommit attribute in connect() has no effect.

== Bugs with SQLite:
* If you supply an optional --rb-dir and config --with=dbd_sqlite, the sqlite portion of the install still tries to install directly into the default tree.

== Bugs with SQLRelay:
* Raises "Failed to get a cursor id" when doing more than 6 successive select queries.

= Broader goals:
* Easier installation
* More documentation
* More Ruby-ish API?
* Optimize
